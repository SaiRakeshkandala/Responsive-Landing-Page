## ✨ How It Works

1. **Fixed Navigation Bar**:  
   The navigation bar is positioned at the top using CSS `position: fixed;`.

2. **Hover Effects**:  
   Each menu item changes its background and text color on hover, thanks to CSS transitions.  

3. **Scrolling Interaction**:  
   JavaScript detects when the user scrolls and dynamically updates the navbar's style by toggling a class.
